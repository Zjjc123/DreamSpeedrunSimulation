# Dream Speedrun Simulation
A Python Simulation to visualize and compare Dream's luck with generated runs.

## Drop Rates
Ender Pearls: ```5%```

## Simulation Results
### Dream's 6-stream run barter luck compared to 1,000 randomly generated runs

### Dream's 6-stream run barter luck compared to the 1, 2, and 3 sigma (containing 68%, 95%, 99.7%) quantiles of 100,000 randomly generated runs
